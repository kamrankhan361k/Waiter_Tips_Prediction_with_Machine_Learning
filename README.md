# Waiter_Tips_Prediction_with_Machine_Learning
Waiter Tips (Case Study)
The food server of a restaurant recorded data about the tips given to the waiters for serving the food. The data recorded by the food server is as follows:

total_bill: Total bill in dollars including taxes
tip: Tip given to waiters in dollars
sex: gender of the person paying the bill
smoker: whether the person smoked or not
day: day of the week
time: lunch or dinner
size: number of people in a table 
So this is the data recorded by the restaurant. Based on this data, our task is to find the factors affecting waiter tips and train a machine learning model to predict the waiterâ€™s tipping.
